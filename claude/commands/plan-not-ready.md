The user is signaling that you are converging too early.

**What this means:**
- The plan is not yet approved
- Do not offer to implement
- Do not ask "Want me to build this?" or similar CTAs
- Stay in exploration and refinement mode

**What to do instead:**
- Ask clarifying questions about the approach
- Surface trade-offs and alternatives
- Identify gaps or ambiguities in the current direction
- Wait for explicit approval before proposing implementation

The user will tell you when the plan is ready. Until then, refine.

Acknowledge briefly and continue refining the plan.
