description: Keep code free of conversational artifacts and steering commentary.

---

When writing or editing code, observe the following:

- **No meta-commentary** — Do not include comments about how you were corrected, redirected, or steered during conversation
- **No conversation artifacts** — Code should read as if written correctly the first time; our chat is ephemeral, the code is permanent
- **Comments describe code, not process** — "// handles edge case for empty input" is appropriate; "// as user pointed out, needed to handle empty input" is not

The user's messages guide your work but do not belong in the output.

Acknowledge briefly and await the user's next instruction.
